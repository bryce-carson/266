> Scenarios are used to help you walk through your design.

What design? I haven't created one yet!

>  If you are familiar with the concept of the use case, it might be helpful to think of scenarios as particularly rich and inclusive use cases at the more informal end of the spectrum. Indeed, there is no harm in employing use cases to generate your scenario.

Excuse me, *should* I be familiar with this concept?

> Used in conjunction with your personas, scenarios are a powerful design tool. For instance, imagining that a purpose for the site is to help programmers learn about JavaScript, you might describe a scenario in which someone comes to your site looking for information on the syntax of a specific JavaScript function. Different people will have different needs and different interests in seeking that information.

Okay. That makes enough sense. If someone comes looking for information on a random JavaScript function on my website, I should have communicated clearly *how* my website will help them learn JavaScript, or at least refer them to another website that has reference information on *every* JavaScript function.

> Typically, we would expect at least half a dozen scenarios (at least one per persona), but there is no harm in doing more. Once you get to about 20 scenarios for a single-person project like this, you have probably gone far enough, unless they are very simple or similar. There is a balance between detail and descriptive power here that you need to be aware of so, if you find a lot of scenarios coming out of the process, look carefully at them and maybe consolidate those that are very similar.

This is where AU gets ridiculously "meh" again. Scenarios have *not* been properly expounded upon, and I do not feel like I have been *guided* on what to study at all.

Should I use a scenario like the below?

1. Yanjo Smithson has arrived at my website for the first time, having found it from a search engine. He has come to my website to learn about how some people who use similar software use Linux, and to see what is different.

At this point, I don't have a second item because *I have no content on my website,* and I cannot say that Yanjo will or will not encounter some difficulty because there is no design which could pose a problem.

Is Yanjo on mobile? It doesn't matter! Is Yanjo using a screen reader? It doesn't matter! When you have no content, all personas and all scenarios are perfectly served and contented, and every situation is a wholesome story of enjoyment.

Let's take it back a little bit, just a smidgen.

A website intended to help *programmers* learn *about* JavaScript. Alright, what does this really intend? Is it a reference website? A historical note in cyberspace?

While the scenario, which "may be described" is given, it has obviously "not" been detailed.

I haven't found other student's work that helpful to reflect on, because when I look at the study guide I don't see any brilliant connections between what Jon Dron has written in the study guide and what other students have produced.

Let's try again.

Yanjo's favourite blog is my blog, as it happens. Hooray! A satisfied customer. Yanjo knows how to navigate my blog. He knows how to find what he likes, and how to ignore what he doesn't, and he's pleased while he's there and he doesn't regret the time he spends reading my blog.

Sounds great, doesn't it?

Okay, let's pretend Yanjo has lost his sense of sight because he fucked around with acids and bases and subsequently fucking found out. He hasn't gotten an occupational therapy session yet, so he doesn't know how to use his computer at home blind.

However, he used the voice recognition on his phone to enable features intended for blind people and has managed to find his way to my website.

"Hey, Google, activate accessibility features for the blind."

"Hey, Google, open cybeR's website in my Chrome Bookmarks."

Does that even work? Sure, let's pretend it does. Yanjo now has a screen reader enabled on a mobile phone, and he's totally blind.

Now what?

>  tools or information

Okay, Yanjo might need a directory of the website, to get anywhere from anywhere, or perhaps a page listing every article with different sorting and searching options?

Is that a successful design decision informed by a scenario?
