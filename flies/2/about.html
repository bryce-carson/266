	  <h1>About</h1>
	  <p>This website is a project website for a first course in web programming (read, JavaScript). The course is designed to teach students the fundamentals of programming, I imagine, using web technologies (JS, HTML, and CSS); the course itself describes it as teaching programming for the web, and learning HTML and CSS are mere byproducts and requirements of that (you can't learn DOM manipulation or do much that is very interesting in JavaScript without learning some HTML, at least). The course is not necessarily targeted to first time programmers, but you absolutely do not need to have any programming experience to take the course.</p>
	  <p>This website is my portfolio as well as a project website. I will continually work on the website, and as I learn more about web design, and programming for the web I will update this website with the things I learn. Evidence of this learning will be made available to visitors through several features of the site:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>a blog,</li>
	    <li>a Git log, maintained using <a href="http://git.codemadness.org/stagit/">Stagit</a>, and (hopefully)</li>
	    <li>a professional appearance and implementation.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>It is hoped that this website will eventually earn me a job with a respectable company, such that I can afford some of the luxuries of modern life, and also contribute back to society as is indicated by the following maxim:</p>
