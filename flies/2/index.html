                    <h1>About this website</h1>
                    <p>This website is a project website for a first course in
                    web programming (read, JavaScript). The course is designed
                    to teach students the fundamentals of programming, I
                    imagine, using web technologies (JS, HTML, and CSS); the
                    course itself describes it as teaching programming for the
                    web, and learning HTML and CSS are mere byproducts and
                    requirements of that (you can't learn DOM manipulation or do
                    much that is very interesting in JavaScript without learning
                    some HTML, at least). The course is not necessarily targeted
                    to first time programmers, but you absolutely do not need to
                    have any programming experience to take the course.</p>
                    <p>This website is my portfolio as well as a project
                    website. I will continually work on the website, and as I
                    learn more about web design, and programming for the web I
                    will update this website with the things I learn. Evidence
                    of this learning will be made available to visitors through
                    several features of the site:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a blog,</li>
                        <li> a Git log, maintained using <span
                        class="software-hyperlink" name="stagit-hyperlink">

                        </span>, and (hopefully)</li>
                        <li>a professional appearance and implementation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It is hoped that this website will eventually earn me a
                    job with a respectable company, such that I can afford some
                    of the luxuries of modern life, and also contribute back to
                    society as is indicated by the following maxim:</p>
