<h1>The Learning Outcomes</h1>

<p>This page provides a brief expansion and overview of what is meant by each learning outcome that you should use when deciding what to do and when mapping outcomes to what you have done. It is not intended to be definitive or complete, but it should give you a rough idea of what each learning outcome means to us and therefore help you to decide whether you have effectively met the criteria.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a name="lo1" id="lo1">Apply a structured approach to identifying needs, interests, and functionality of a website: </a></dt><a name="lo1" id="lo1">
  <dd>You should be able to apply techniques such as personas, scenarios, site maps, and mock-ups to create design documents that other developers could use to create a website. These techniques should be well enough applied that a designer can refer back to and understand how the  actual design is informed by and based on the outputs of this process.<br><br></dd>

  </a><dt><a name="lo1" id="lo1"></a><a name="lo2" id="lo1">Design dynamic websites that meet specified needs and interests:</a></dt><a name="lo2" id="lo1">
  <dd>As well as following a structured design process, the site design and content should very clearly relate to the needs that were identified in the design documentation. While the previous outcome is largely about process and technique, this outcome is largely about explicitly addressing the needs of users.<br><br></dd>

  </a><dt><a name="lo2" id="lo1"></a><a name="lo3" id="lo1">Write well-structured, easily maintained, standards-compliant, accessible HTML code:</a></dt><a name="lo3" id="lo1">
  <dd>There are very clear standards set out by the W3 Consortium that dictate how good HTML should be written, both from a technical perspective and in order that it should be accessible by users with disabilities and with many different browsers and browser types.<br><br> In addition to following the rules that W3C provides, the code should be laid out, commented and structured in a way that makes it easy for other developers to understand precisely how the document is structured, what it contains, which part does what. <br><br>We would expect you to know and make use of a wide range of HTML tags and attributes including at a minimum (but not be limited to) header styles, lists, tables, images, hyperlinks, anchors, &lt;div&gt;s, &lt;span&gt;s, document structure (&lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, etc.), forms and form controls, text emphases, pre-formatted text, HTML entities, and comments.<br><br></dd>

  </a><dt><a name="lo3" id="lo1"></a><a name="lo4" id="lo1">Write well-structured, easily maintained, standards-compliant CSS code to present HTML pages in different ways:</a></dt><a name="lo4" id="lo1">
  <dd>As for HTML, standards for CSS code are set out by the W3 Consortium and we would expect all students to follow those standards to the letter, as well as writing elegant and maintainably structured code. We would expect to see a wide range of CSS selectors used correctly and a good range of declarations used to handle, at the very least, positioning, font-styles, colours, borders, visibility, and graphics. We would expect code to work in all browsers as well as possible.<br><br> </dd>

  </a><dt><a name="lo4" id="lo1"></a><a name="lo5" id="lo1">Use JavaScript to add dynamic content to pages: </a></dt><a name="lo5" id="lo1">
  <dd>This addresses a minimal requirement that students should be able to take a piece of JavaScript code from another site and use it effectively in their own, as well as (of course) effectively embedding their own code in a page.<br><br></dd>

</a><div class="top-bottom"><a name="lo5" id="lo1">
</a><p><a name="lo5" id="lo1"></a><a href="https://scis.lms.athabascau.ca/file.php/310/html/outcomesexpansion.html#top" title="top">TOP</a></p>
</div>

  <dt><a name="lo6" id="lo1">Critique JavaScript code written by others, identifying examples of both good and bad practice:</a></dt><a name="lo6" id="lo1">
  <dd>You should be able to identify problems with how a piece of code is written. This may relate to, mainly, maintainability (for instance, does it use consistent variable names, is it properly indented, is it well commented?)  and structural/logical design ( is it efficient, does it use arrays and loops effectively, does it separate data, processing and views effectively?)<br><br></dd>

  </a><dt><a name="lo6" id="lo1"></a><a name="lo7" id="lo1">Select appropriate HTML, CSS and JavaScript code from public repositories of open-source and free scripts that enhances the experience of site visitors </a></dt><a name="lo7" id="lo1">
  <dd>This is about finding useful, well-written, reliable code and adding it to a site, taking into account legal and technical constraints as well as taking explicit account of the needs of the site users and the site purpose.<br><br></dd>

  </a><dt><a name="lo7" id="lo1"></a><a name="lo8" id="lo1">Modify existing HTML, CSS and JavaScript code to extend and alter its functionality, and to correct errors and cases of poor practice:</a></dt><a name="lo8" id="lo1">
  <dd>Having found useful code, you should be able to modify it to work well with the site, bearing in mind the learning outcomes that relate to critiquing and writng good HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br><br></dd>

  </a><dt><a name="lo8" id="lo1"></a><a name="lo9" id="lo1">Write well-structured, easily maintained JavaScript code following accepted good practice: </a></dt><a name="lo9" id="lo1">
  <dd>As in the case of HTML and CSS, this relates to creating code that is elegant, well-structured and conforming with specified standards. The code should be very maintainable and structured for ease of maintenance, with careful structuring, consistent use of declared variables using standard naming conventions (e.g., camelCase), good error handling and modularity.<br><br>The code should be elegant, using the minimum necessary code to work efficiently while still remaining maintainableâ€”not too complex, not too dense.<br><br> You are expected to use a wide range of programming constructs and techniques, including but not necessarily limited to variables, arrays, operators, selections, loops, functions, objects, regular expressions, recursion, string manipulation, numeric calculations, date manipulation and formatting, use of events, good manipulation of the DOM (including manipulation of HTML, manipulation of styles, use of named elements and classes, etc.), error and exception handling, etc. In the event of JavaScript not being available, the code should either continue to work or fail gracefully, remaining accessible as much as possible throughout.<br><br> </dd>

  </a><dt><a name="lo9" id="lo1"></a><a name="lo10" id="lo1">Write JavaScript code that works in all major browsers (including E, Mozilla-based browsers such as Firefox, Opera, Konqueror, Safari, Chrome):</a></dt><a name="lo10" id="lo1">
  <dd>Different browsers have different DOMs and different JavaScript interpreters. The code should work in all popular modern browsers (at the time of writing, anything after IE6).<br><br></dd>

  </a><dt><a name="lo10" id="lo1"></a><a name="lo11" id="lo1">Effectively debug JavaScript code, making use of good practice and debugging tools:</a></dt><a name="lo11" id="lo1">
  <dd>The evidence for this is going to be both bug-free code and reflections on the process of creating it.<br><br> </dd>

  </a><dt><a name="lo11" id="lo1"></a><a name="lo12" id="lo1">Use JavaScript libraries (e.g., JQuery) to create dynamic pages:</a></dt><a name="lo12" id="lo1">
  <dd>You should have created pages that make effective use of JQuery libraries to enhance the user experience, in line with the themes, purposes, personas, and scenarios you have identified. While the emphasis is on appropriate use, a  range of several JQuery library facilities should have been used such as animation, data hiding/showing, ordering of lists and tables, and asynchronous data access.<br><br></dd>

  </a><dt><a name="lo12" id="lo1"></a><a name="lo13" id="lo1">Use JavaScript to access and use web services for dynamic content (AJAX, JSON, etc.):</a></dt><a name="lo13" id="lo1">
  <dd>You should be able to both send and receive data from an external service via that service's API and manipulate the results returned to add value to the page, in accordance with themes, purposes, scenarios, and personas developed for the course. A good student will link the content from multiple sources to create a mashup. The code will fail gracefully in the event of a service being unavailable and will not simply embed content directly from another site without further manipulation, if only for formatting.<br></dd>
