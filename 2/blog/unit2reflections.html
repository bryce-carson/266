                <h2>Screencast about Unit 2</h2>
                <p>The embedded video below has HTML that I did not write, and
                    is only included due to the size restrictions on what I can
                    upload to the Landing on Athabasca. A smaller form of the
                    video will be uploaded to the Landing for parity, but the
                    embedded video or the shared link should be sufficient.</p>
                <p>The length of the video, and other demands of my personal
                    life make captioning the video for accessibility purposes
                    difficult at the moment. I will attempt to ensure that all
                    future materials on the website will have the highest degree
                    of accessibility.</p>

                <p>This unit was a little difficult for me because I only worked
                on the website for a long while sporadically. Much of the work
                was spread out over time and that made it difficult to write a
                lot of the content and ensure that I had things completed.</p>
