<p>Personas</p>
<p>They represent your generalized or hypothetical users. Personas are created to replicate your actual users who are going to use your end product. They serve a great reference point in your development phase, as they resemble your users.</p>
<p>Stage: Best suited for Early Development phase.</p>
<p>Duration: Two to Five days, over two weeks.</p>
<hr>
<p>very persona answers the questions listed below:</p>
<pre><code>Who is your audience?
What is their background?
What experiences have they had?
What are they looking to accomplish?
What are some challenges they face?
What are some potential ways to address those challenges?</code></pre>
<p>In the creation of your personas, be sure to cover these questions in order to get a complete understanding of your users.</p>
<h1 id="for-every-persona">For every persona</h1>
<pre><code>a name;
a picture (any random photo will do, but avoid well-known public figures unless they are your target audience—make sure you cite this correctly!);
demographics (age, gender, cultural group, religion, etc.);
knowledge and skills (particularly as they relate to the site or its contents);
goals and motives (particularly as they relate to your site and why they would be coming there);
approach to using the site (are they butterflies or crawlers? do they like structure or do they like to dive in? are they casual visitors or likely to keep coming back?, etc.)</code></pre>

<p>Occupation: Data engineer</p>
<p>Cultural identity: Jewish–Canadian</p>
<p>Religion: Reform Judaism</p>
<p>Alma matter: UToronto</p>
<p>Salary: $75,000–$90,000</p>
<p>Skills: machine learning, statistics, bayesian statistics, SQL, Python, R, VBA, Microsoft Office, Tableau ;; relation to my site: data scientists spend a lot of time reading programming blogs from other creators to both find inspiration, learn new methods, and use them as reference when they’re troubleshooting a data pipeline; it’s also fun to see what is going on in the lives of other data professionals ;; Yanjo Smithson is not experienced with Linux™ or UNIX®, as he has worked at Microsoft–consuming offices during his career, and only uses Windows® on his home workstation;; Yanjo loves to learn about how scientists and data professionals use R and Python in their work, he often learns something new or has an uncommon or obscure aspect of a methodology or a programming language refreshed in his mind when he reads a programming blog — “It’s a lot more fun to read and browse than refernce material like a specification. I don’t learn a lot from specs, I only consult them for, well, reference; like when I need to know what arguments or data types a function accepts and returns.”.</p>
<p>Goals and motives: Yanjo Smithson loves to read about programming, Data science, statistics, and computers in general; his friends on the internet use Linux, and he’d like to learn more about it to see if he can use it to make his workflow more efficient.</p>
<p>Approach to site use: Yanjo usually sees what’s on offer before he finds something of interest, he doesn’t like to see the whole history of the blog. He uses a search bar when its there, or a tag cloud, but when those aren’t present he looks at the headings until he finds something interesting, and then reads that through if it holds his interest after the first paragraph or two. If its something he needs to know about, then he reads the whole blog entry, but he hates when there is no table of contents or useful headings that summarize a longer entry; when the entry is badly written or doesn’t discuss something new or more advanced he gets annoyed about his wasted time. He has few favourite blogs that he checks first when he feels like reading, or when he needs to search something up, but if they don’t have it then he looks for tutorials or blogs on Google (he doesn’t like Bing!).</p>
